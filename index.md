Hello world! My name is Ellen <3

I am PhD candidate in chemical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. My research uses [Biogeochemical Argo](https://biogeochemical-argo.org/) (BGC-Argo) floats to better understand carbon and oxygen cycling in the global ocean.

My thesis research explores:
- quantifying biological carbon pump parameters in the global ocean from the BGC-Argo float array
- characterizing the dynamic response time of oxygen optodes for profiling float applications
- oxygen dynamics in the Labrador Sea, as a part of the Gases in the Overturning and Horizontal circulation of the Subpolar North Atlantic Program [(GOHSNAP)](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/linking-oxygen-and-carbon-uptake-with-the-meridional-overturning-circulation-using-a-transport-mooring-array)

I am also leveraging the power of machine learning to help maximize the utility of observational datasets.

Before pursing her doctorate degree, Ellen completed her undergraduate degree at Cornell University (2020), where she received a B.S. in chemical engineering and a B.S. in earth and atmospheric sciences.
