I am PhD candidate in chemical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. My research uses [Biogeochemical Argo](https://biogeochemical-argo.org/) (BGC-Argo) floats to better understand carbon and oxygen cycling in the global ocean.

My thesis research explores:
- quantifying biological carbon pump parameters in the global ocean from the BGC-Argo float array
- characterizing the dynamic response time of oxygen optodes for profiling float applications
- oxygen dynamics in the Labrador Sea, as a part of the Gases in the Overturning and Horizontal circulation of the Subpolar North Atlantic Program [(GOHSNAP)](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/linking-oxygen-and-carbon-uptake-with-the-meridional-overturning-circulation-using-a-transport-mooring-array)

I am also leveraging the power of machine learning to help maximize the utility of observational datasets.

Before pursing my doctorate degree, I completed my undergraduate degree at Cornell University (2020), where I received a B.S. in chemical engineering and a B.S. in earth and atmospheric sciences.
